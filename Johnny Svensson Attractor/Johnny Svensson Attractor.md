# Johnny Svensson Attractor

## Information
The value of x and y in this strange attractor are calculated through the following equations: <br><br>
```x = d * sin(x * a) - sin(y * b)``` <br><br>
```y = c * cos(x * a) + cos(y * b)``` <br><br>

Where the values of a, b, c and d are defined as: 

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ------|
| a | 1.40 |
| b | 1.56 |
| c | 1.40 |
| d | -6.56 |

## Output
Over 100,000 iterations, the following attractor is produced: <br><br>
