# Strange Attractors

Strange attractors are a concept in the field of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. They are a type of mathematical object that describes the behavior of certain dynamic systems.

In a dynamic system, the state of the system evolves over time based on a set of equations. The behavior of the system can be sensitive to initial conditions, meaning that even small changes in the starting state can lead to significantly different outcomes.

An attractor is a subset of the system's state space, which represents the set of states towards which the system tends to evolve over time. In simple systems, attractors are often stable points (equilibrium states) or periodic orbits, meaning the system settles into a fixed point or repeats a pattern.

However, strange attractors are different. They exhibit complex and chaotic behavior. Unlike regular attractors, strange attractors are characterized by intricate geometric patterns and non-repeating trajectories. The term "strange" refers to the unusual, intricate nature of their behavior.

Strange attractors can have fractal properties, meaning that they exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They can have an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits and exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which is a hallmark of chaos.

One of the most well-known examples of a strange attractor is the Lorenz attractor, named after the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a simplified system of equations describing atmospheric convection. It exhibits a butterfly-shaped pattern in its state space trajectory.

Strange attractors have been studied in various fields, including physics, mathematics, biology, and economics. They provide insights into the behavior of complex systems, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes over time.

In this repository, I have visualized a few strange attractors with code I have written in python.

## Preconditions
1. You must have Python insalled on your system. You can download python by visiting [this link.](https://www.python.org)

2. You must have Pip Package Installer for Python on your system. You can get it from [here.](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

3. Some packages that need to be installed are matplotlib and numpy. Open your terminal and enter the following commands:<br>
   ```pip3 install numpy``` <br>
   ```pip3 install matplotlib```

4. Open the Python scripts and run them.

## Notes
Some scripts are running over 100,000 iterations, the output might be slow depending on your system.

All the folders include information for that particular strange attractor.
